# Deployment Instructions for Forge Fitness

This project is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS (via CDN). It is designed to be deployed instantly to Vercel with zero configuration changes.

## Prerequisites
1. A GitHub account.
2. A Vercel account (free).
3. The project folder on your local machine.
4. Ensure the logo file `ChatGPT_Image_Feb_8__2026__07_49_13_PM-removebg-preview.png` is in the root folder.

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

1.  Open your terminal in the project root directory.
2.  Initialize a git repository:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
3.  Add all files:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
4.  Commit the files:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit for Forge Fitness"
    ```
5.  Go to GitHub.com and create a new public repository named `forge-fitness`.
6.  Follow the GitHub instructions to push your local code:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/forge-fitness.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1.  Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in.
2.  Click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
3.  Select your GitHub account and find the `forge-fitness` repository you just created.
4.  Click **"Import"**.
5.  **Build Configuration**:
    *   **Framework Preset**: Create React App (should be detected automatically).
    *   **Root Directory**: ./ (default).
    *   **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default).
    *   **Output Directory**: `build` (default).
6.  Click **"Deploy"**.

## Step 3: Verify

1.  Wait for the deployment to finish (usually 1 minute).
2.  Click on the generated domain (e.g., `forge-fitness.vercel.app`).
3.  Check the following:
    *   Does the Logo load?
    *   Does the Navbar work?
    *   Click "Contact" -> Does the Map load?
    *   Test "Join via WhatsApp" button on mobile.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Logo not showing?** Ensure the filename is exactly `ChatGPT_Image_Feb_8__2026__07_49_13_PM-removebg-preview.png` and it is committed to GitHub in the root folder.
*   **Routing 404s?** The app uses `HashRouter`, so refreshing pages should work fine on static hosting like Vercel.
